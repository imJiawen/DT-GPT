# DT-GPT: Large Language Models for Patient Health Trajectory Forecasting

Code to run the experiments for the paper ["Large Language Models forecast Patient Health Trajectories enabling Digital Twins"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.05.24309957v2).

>❗ **NOTE:**  We are working on a Python library that will enable easier conversions, that is both indication agnostic and generally better engineered. This repo is more towards exploratory experiments, often with dead ends and potentially redundant code. Please raise an issue if something is missing or unclear.


## Installation


```python
# First install a fresh environment
cd DT-GPT
/n/home07/jiawezhang/.conda/envs/dtgpt/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
/n/home07/jiawezhang/.conda/envs/dtgpt/bin/python -m pip install -e .
```


## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of DT-GPT (Digital Twin GPT), a framework for using Large Language Models to forecast patient health trajectories. The codebase is organized into three main components: pipeline infrastructure, experimental runs, and exploratory analyses.

Developed as a collaboration project by Roche, Helmholtz Munich & LMU.

In case of any questions, please reach out to [Nikita Makarov](nikita.makarov@roche.com) or [Michael Menden](michael.menden@unimelb.edu.au).

5. **DT-GPT**: Our instruction-based approach for patient trajectory forecasting

## Dataset Support

The codebase supports multiple healthcare datasets:
- **Critical Care Variables**: ICU patient monitoring data
- **MIMIC-IV**: Publicly available critical care database
- **ADNI**: Alzheimer's disease progression data

## Data

Due to license restrictions, each dataset needs to be accessed from the respective organisation. In case of any specific data preprocessing questions that are not clear from the code, please reach out to [nikita.makarov@roche.com](nikita.makarov@roche.com) or [michael.menden@unimelb.edu.au](michael.menden@unimelb.edu.au). Additionally, we use the custom R library `FlatironTimeSeries` for preprocessing the Flatiron data, please reach out to us in case you need access to it.

The data preprocessing scripts are located in their respective dataset folders under `1_data`, with each indication having its own README. Please note, that you will need to adjust the paths in the scripts to your specific system setup.



### Example processed input and output on synthetic patient

This is the final processed text version for DT-GPT on a synthetic patient, in the NSCLC set up. Note, if you run this in vLLM, you need to use the completions enpoint (i.e. not using chat completions or chat templates). The ` <patient_prediction>` part is an essential input for the model.

Input:
```
First, patient chronological patient history up until the current day. Patient visits for the first time, with the following values: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified is diagnosed, Essential (primary) hypertension is diagnosed, ECOG is 1, <...>.
135 days after previous visit, patient visits again, with the following values: ECOG is 1, neutrophils.segmented is 2.8, <...>.
17 days after previous visit, patient visits again, with the following values: ECOG is 1, alanine aminotransferase is 6, <...>.
7 days after previous visit, <...>.

<...>

Next, the baseline data for the patient:  birth year is 1953, gender is M, ses index is 3, is cancer advanced is True, histology is Non-squamous cell carcinoma, cancer stage is Stage IV, smoking status is History of smoking, ethnicity is Not Hispanic or Latino, Current line of therapy is Pembrolizumab, Current line number is 2.
Finally, the variables which you should predict, and for which days in the future from the current day: {"hemoglobin": [21, 42, 63, 70, 77, 84]}
Now, your task is as follows: Given the non small cell lung cancer patient's history, please predict for this patient the previously noted down variables and future days, in the same JSON format. <patient_prediction>
```

Output:
```
{"hemoglobin": ["10.8", "11.3", "11.2", "11.6", "11.7", "11.7"]}
```
